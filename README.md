# CMPLXSY-Prey-Predator
Agent-based predator-prey ecosystem simulation using NetLogo
An agent-based model was used to simulate predator-prey ecosystems where foxes are the predators and rabbits are the prey. Different parameters of the model can be adjusted to simulate different scenarios.

## Agents:
1. Fox
- These agents are the predators and gain energy by consuming rabbits upon contact. They also have a certain probability of reproducing at every step.
2. Rabbit
- These agents are the prey and gain energy by consuming carrots upon landing on a patch that is orange. They also have a certain probability of reproducing at every step.


## Adjustable parameters
1. Initial Number of Rabbits
2. Initial Number of Foxes
3. Reproduction Rate
4. Carrot Energy
5. Rabbit Energy
